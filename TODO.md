  - Implement trust chain resolution history
  - Add metrics and monitoring for federation operations

- [ ] **Advanced Trust Chain Management**
  - Support for trust chain caching
  - Implement trust chain validation optimization
  - Add support for trust marks and trust mark issuers

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] **Key Rotation and Management**
  - Implement automatic key rotation
  - Add key versioning and rollover
  - Support for hardware security modules (HSM)

- [ ] **Enhanced Validation**
  - Add comprehensive JWT validation
  - Implement signature verification caching
  - Add support for certificate-based validation

### Operational Features
- [ ] **Administrative Interface**
  - Web-based admin panel for subordinate management
  - Real-time federation status monitoring
  - Trust chain visualization tools

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement entity statement caching
  - Add response compression

  - Support for multiple trust anchor instances
  - Tenant isolation and management
  - Per-tenant configuration and policies

### Integration & Compatibility
- [ ] **Protocol Extensions**
  - Support for automatic client configuration
  - Implement federation-specific grants
  - Add support for federation logout

- [ ] **External System Integration**
  - Add SAML bridge functionality
  - Implement attribute mapping and transformation
  - Support for legacy identity systems

### Documentation & Tooling
- [ ] **Developer Tools**
  - Federation testing and validation tools
  - Trust chain debugging utilities
  - Client integration examples and SDKs

- [ ] **Production Readiness**
  - High availability deployment guides
  - Load balancing and scaling documentation
  - Disaster recovery procedures

## üêõ Known Issues

### External Validation
- **External federation validator issue**: Some external OpenID Federation implementations incorrectly build trust chains by fetching self-issued statements instead of using the `/resolve` endpoint. This is a bug in their implementation, not ours.

### Performance Considerations
- **Trust chain resolution**: Currently performs real-time resolution. Consider implementing caching for production deployments.

## üéØ Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Complete external trust anchor integration testing
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement metadata policies for production readiness
3. **Medium Priority**: Add administrative interface for easier management
4. **Low Priority**: Performance optimizations and advanced features

## üìä Success Metrics

- [x] **Basic Federation**: Trust anchor can issue and resolve subordinate statements
- [x] **OIDC Compatibility**: Successfully proxies authentication to upstream providers
- [ ] **Standards Compliance**: Passes OpenID Federation specification validation
- [ ] **External Integration**: Successfully integrates with eduGAIN and SURF infrastructures
- [ ] **Production Ready**: Supports high-availability deployment scenarios

## üîç Testing Status

- [x] **Unit Tests**: Core federation functionality
- [x] **Integration Tests**: OIDC proxy functionality
- [ ] **Compliance Tests**: OpenID Federation specification compliance
- [ ] **Load Tests**: Performance under high load
- [ ] **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and security validation
