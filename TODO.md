## OP Component Improvement Plan

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] Verify JWT signatures and validate claims (exp, iat, aud, iss) for all incoming tokens
- [ ] Remove deprecated imports (e.g., io/ioutil)
- [ ] Add security headers (CORS, CSP, etc.) to all HTTP responses
- [ ] Implement replay protection for state/nonce values
- [ ] Rate limit sensitive endpoints (registration, token)

### Reliability & Scalability
- [ ] Move session/state management from in-memory map to Redis or distributed cache
- [ ] Support JWKS key rotation and multiple keys
- [ ] Expand health check endpoint and add metrics for monitoring

### OIDC Features
- [ ] Support refresh tokens and logout endpoint
- [ ] Validate all required OIDC claims in tokens and responses
- [ ] Modularize code: split handlers and utilities into separate files

### Testing & Maintenance
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for all critical flows
- [ ] Use structured logging for better traceability
- [ ] Load secrets/config from environment variables or secure stores

_Update this list as improvements are completed or new tasks are identified._

# Signature Verification

When processing JWTs (e.g., registration JWTs, id_tokens), always verify signatures and validate claims (exp, iat, aud, iss) for security, not just parse unverified.

# Error Handling and Logging

Use structured logging for better traceability.
Avoid leaking sensitive error details to clients; log them internally.

# Session Management

If you use in-memory maps for session/state, consider persistence or distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for scalability and reliability.

# Replay Protection

Ensure state/nonce values are single-use and cannot be replayed.

# Configuration Management

Load secrets and config from environment variables or secure stores, not just files.

# JWKS Rotation

Implement key rotation and support multiple keys in JWKS for future-proofing.

# OIDC Compliance

Validate all required claims in tokens and responses.
Support additional OIDC features (refresh tokens, logout, etc.) if needed.

# Security Headers

Add security headers (CORS, CSP, etc.) to HTTP responses.

# Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection

Protect endpoints (especially registration and token) from abuse.

# Health and Metrics Endpoints

Expand health checks and add metrics for monitoring.

# Code Maintenance

Remove deprecated imports (e.g., io/ioutil).
Modularize code for maintainability (split handlers, utils, etc.).

# Testing

Add unit and integration tests for all critical flows.
